<h1>Objective</h1>
<p>To test your ability to dockerize and deploy flask app.</p>
<h1>Instructions</h1>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Before anything else, check if there's any new updates by <a href="https://gitlab.com/startupcampus.be/startup-campus-backend#sync-repository">syncing new updates to your private repository</a>. Do this everytime you are notified that there are new updates.</p>
<p>Then create a new Merge Request for this assigment by following these steps:
- Go to your repo homepage (<code>https://gitlab.com/&lt;your_gitlab_username&gt;/startup-campus-backend</code>)
- From the left sidepanel, go to <code>Repository &gt; Branches</code>
- Click <code>New Branch</code> button on the top right
- Input <code>assignment-6</code> on the Branch name, make sure you are creating from <code>main</code> branch and then click <code>Create branch</code>
- Wait until redirected to a new page with a notification that you just pushed to your new branch, click <code>Create merge request</code>
- In the <code>New merge request</code> page
  - Check <strong>Squash commits ...</strong> option on the bottom
  - Feel free to leave everything else as is
  - Click <code>Create Merge Request</code></p>
<p>and you should be done! </p>
<p>You can now start working on your local machine by clicking  <code>Code &gt; Check out branch</code> from the new Merge Request page.</p>
<h2>Pre-work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you already install docker and docker-compose</li>
</ul>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you will try to do the following :
- dockerize flask app inside the folder "./app"
- create docker image using dockerfile with this information:
    - for base image, you can use python:3.9-slim-buster
    - the working directory will be at ./app
    - you should install all the library inside "requirements.txt"</p>
<ul>
<li>create docker-compose file to run the application in docker with this information:<ul>
<li>you should create 2 container, for the flask app and db</li>
<li>flask app should be deployed within port 5000</li>
<li>flask app container name should be "library"</li>
<li>db will be deployed within port 5432 </li>
<li>db will be use postgresql image</li>
<li>db container name should be "library-db"</li>
<li>both db and flask app must be accessible from outside your vm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>deploy this application using docker in cloud, u can use gcp compute engine vm instance</li>
<li>you should publish your flask image to docker hub: https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/#step-5-build-and-push-a-container-image-to-docker-hub-from-your-computer</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:
- for those who using GCP, you should open both port 5000 and 5432, for more information: https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-firewalls</p>
<p>If you encounter any issues understanding the problem statement, feel free to ask and reach out to your mentors!</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Your grade will be mainly deducd by the amount of test cases you manage to pass across the whole problem sets. See Testing on how to check your live grades.</p>
<p>Mentors will also check your codes (in the Merge Request) to ensure no cheating attempts is performed.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>To test locally, go to the relative path for assignment 6
<code>cd
cd startup-campus-backend/Assigments/Assignment6</code></p>
<p>then run
<code>docker-compose up</code></p>
<ul>
<li>you will be able to access your app via curl to localhost:5000</li>
<li>you will be able to access your postgres db with this command:
<code>docker exec -it library-db -U users -d library-db</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>Push your changes to the branch (created via Merge Request) and simply <strong>copy paste the Merge Request URL</strong> into the corresponding <strong>Assignment folder</strong> in your <strong>Google Classroom</strong> account.</p>
